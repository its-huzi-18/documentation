I have completed the hackathon focused on laying the foundation for my website. During this hackathon, I outlined my website's purpose, business goals, the goals of this business, the problems my website can solve, my target audience, and the services my website provides. Additionally, I explored my unique selling point that can make my website different from others and help me target my audience with these selling strategies. Finally, I defined my data schema to ensure a solid backend structure for my website.

For this challenge, I selected the General E-commerce option and focused on creating a furniture marketplace. My approach involved:
Defining the primary purpose of the marketplace.
Clearly outlining the business goals based on the provided requirements.
Designing and presenting a detailed schema to map out the marketplace’s structure and functionality.
This experience was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my skills in planning and structuring an online platform while ensuring that the goals align with a scalable and user-friendly design.

Completing this task successfully has boosted my confidence, and I’m eager to tackle the upcoming challenges in this hackathon!
